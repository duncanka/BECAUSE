T16	Argument 1479 1510	these banks are too big to fail
T17	Argument 1512 1650	they have lower funding costs, they are able to attract more capital, they make more money over the cycle, and they continue to get larger

T18	Argument 2056 2165	we allow our biggest banks to continue to build on these unfair market advantages and the lower funding costs
T19	Argument 2167 2201	we will head in the same direction
A2	Degree E2 Facilitate
T20	Argument 2207 2366	I think I would suggest to you that you consider imposing a size cap on banks relative not to total normal assets or liabilities, which is the Volcker proposal
T21	Argument 2376 2400	that is not bubble-proof
A3	Degree E3 Facilitate
T22	Argument 2405 2508	you have a massive increase in house prices, real estate prices, such as happened in Japan in the 1980s

A4	Degree E4 Facilitate
T24	Argument 3253 3351	you were to impose a size cap of, say, 3 or 5 percent of GDP, no bank can be larger than that size
T25	Argument 3353 3445	that would return our biggest banks roughly to the position that they had in the early 1990s
A5	Degree E7 Facilitate
T29	Argument 4612 4714	they have to pay a lot more money--they pay higher interest for funds, their cost of capital is higher

A15	Degree E17 Facilitate
T47	Argument 9084 9361	I think the two keys to Mr. Volcker's suggestion, that of segregation of function within the industry and particularly the protection of the large deposit-taking institutions and the idea of being concerned about size, have merit and deserve the consideration of this Committee
T48	Argument 9435 9503	JPMorgan Chase did better than many others during this recent crisis
T49	Argument 9507 9599	they did not have embedded in that institution a real money market activity, a trading house
